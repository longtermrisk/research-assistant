Can you do the following mprovements for the frontend?
- subagent calls: render links to the subagent thread
- when a user message only consists of tool calls, don't render it and merge the content blocks of the assistant messages that come before and after
- copy button for messages
- threads: don't show ID, instead show first words of first user message
- user message text area: make it grow when input is multiline
- user message text area: allow sending images (drag and drop or copy&paste)
