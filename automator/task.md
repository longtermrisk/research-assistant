Can you implement the following improvements for the frontend?

# Sending messages with multilines and images
- user message text area: make it grow when input is multiline
- user message text area: allow sending images (drag and drop and copy&paste should both work)
- it should be possible to send any number of images in one message

This might require changes to the backend.
